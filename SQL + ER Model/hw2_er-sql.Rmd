```{r setupdb, include=FALSE}
# make sure you write the path to your sqlite path here
db <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "lahman2016.sqlite")
```


1) How many franchises are listed in the database (see [`count`](https://sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html#count))?

```{sql q1, connection=db, eval=TRUE}

SELECT COUNT(*)

FROM TeamsFranchises

```

2) How many franchises are currently active?

```{sql q2, connection=db, eval=TRUE}

SELECT COUNT(active)

FROM TeamsFranchises

WHERE active = 'Y'

```

3) Which teams won more than 100 games in one season between 2000 and 2015? Order result by descending number of wins. (attribute `W` of the Teams table contains the number of wins)

```{sql q3, connection=db, eval=TRUE}

SELECT teamID, W

FROM Teams

WHERE Teams.yearid >= 2000 AND Teams.yearid <= 2015 AND teams.W >= 100

ORDER BY W DESC

```


4) What is the franchise name of the team with the most total wins in the database?

```{sql q4, connection=db, eval=TRUE}

SELECT franchID, MAX(SUM)

from (SELECT franchID, SUM(W) AS SUM

FROM Teams

GROUP BY franchID)

```

5) What is the franchise name of the team with the highest winning percentage in a season in the database? (Win percentage is `W/G`)

```{sql q5, connection=db, eval=TRUE}

SELECT franchID, MAX(percentage)

FROM (

SELECT franchID, 100.0 * W / G as percentage

FROM Teams)

```

6) What is the franchise name of the team with the highest single-year payroll between 2000 and 2015?

```{sql q6, connection=db, eval=TRUE}

Select franchID, sum from

(SELECT teamID, yearID, MAX(sum) as sum from

(SELECT teamID, yearID, SUM(salary) as sum

FROM Salaries

WHERE yearID >= 2000 and yearID <= 2015

GROUP BY teamID, yearID)) as joint_t join Teams

on joint_t.teamID = Teams.teamID and joint_t.yearID = teams.yearid

```

7) (BONUS from [MDSR book](https://mdsr-book.github.io/)): Identify players (by first and last name) that have attained through their career either a) 500 or more HRs or b) 3000 or more hits (H) _and_ have not been inducted to the Hall of Fame (see `HallOfFame` table).

```{sql q7, connection=db, eval=TRUE}

Select nameFirst, nameLast from 

(Select total_id from 

(Select players_new.playerID as total_id, total_hr, total_h, inducted from 

(SELECT playerID, total_hr, total_h from 

(SELECT playerID, SUM(HR) as total_hr, SUM(H) as total_h

from Batting

GROUP BY playerID)

where total_hr >= 500 or total_h >= 3000) as players_new 

inner join HallOfFame on players_new.playerID = HallofFame.playerID

group by total_id)

where inducted = 'N') as hof_no inner join Master 

on hof_no.total_id = Master.playerID


```

```{r disconnectdb, include=FALSE}
DBI::dbDisconnect(db)
